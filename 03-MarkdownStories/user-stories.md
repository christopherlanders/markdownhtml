# Twitter 
  Twitter is an online news and social networking site where people communicate in short messages called tweets. Tweeting is posting short messages for anyone who follows you on Twitter, with the hope that your words are useful and interesting to someone in your audience.

## How Twitter Works 
 1. Tweeting - Go to the What's Happening box next to your profile image, type 280 or fewer characters, and click Tweet. People who follow you, and potentially others who don't, will see your tweet. 
 2. Following- To receive Twitter feeds, find someone interesting (celebrities included) and press Follow to subscribe to their tweets. If their tweets aren't as interesting as you hoped, you can always unfollow them.
 3. Trending - Go to your account at Twitter.com day or night to read your Twitter feed, which is continually changing as people post. Check out Trending topics to see what's going on in the world.
